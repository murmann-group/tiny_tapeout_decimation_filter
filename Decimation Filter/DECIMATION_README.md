# Decimation Filter

## How it works
Connect an ADC that produces a 1-bit output through oversampling to the input of a decimation filter. The Delta-Sigma modulator produces data at a much higher rate than required, and the decimation filter serves two key functions: it removes high-frequency quantization noise and reduces the data rate.

The decimation filter is crucial because it eliminates unwanted high-frequency noise generated during oversampling while downsampling the data. This ensures that the ADCâ€™s output is easier to manage and process, without sacrificing signal quality.

Without the decimation filter, the oversampled output from the Delta-Sigma ADC would carry excessive noise and an unnecessarily high data rate, making it inefficient and challenging for further processing.

## Structure between Di and Dout 
* Two blocks are both gated counters/accumulators. Both accumulators in series with one another creates a quadratic output. 

* The input is a single bit coming from the Delta Sigma ADC and the output is a 16 bit value. In our implementation, the Decimation filter is used to reduce the sample frequency by a factor of 4.

   $H(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}} = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}$
   
   $Y(z) (1 - z^{-1}) = X(z)$
   
   $Y(n) - Y(n - 1) = X(n)$
   
   $Y(n) = X(n) + Y(n - 1)$

   To find the impulse response, we replace x(n) with the unit impulse $\delta(n)$.

   We first start with the intial condition $y(-1) = 0$:

   $y(0) = 1 + 0$

   $y(1) = 0 + 1$

   $y(2) = 0 + 1$
   
   Thus, we see that the impulse response of the filter is 0 for n < 0 and 1 for n $\geq$ 0, so $h_{i}[n] = u[n]$.

### Comb
   $c[n] = x[n] - x[n - L]$

Impulse Response

   $h_{c}[n] = \delta[n] - \delta[n - L]$

Frequency Response

   $H_{c}(e^{jw}) = \sum_{n} h_{c}[n]e^{-jwn}$

   $H_{c}(e^{jw}) = \delta[n]^{-jwn} - \delta[n - L]^{-jwn}$

   $H_{c}(e^{jw}) = 1 - e^{-jwL}$

   At $\delta[n-n_{0}]$ is 1 at $n_{0}$ and zero everwhere else.

   $H_{c}(e^{jw}) = e^{-jw\frac{L}{2}}(e^{+jw\frac{L}{2}} - e^{-jw\frac{L}{2}})$

   $H_{c}(e^{jw}) = e^{-jw\frac{L}{2}} \cdot j2sin(w\frac{L}{2})$

   In terms of iscrete frequency:
   
   $H_{c}(f) = e^{-j\pi Lf} \cdot j2sin(\pi Lf)$

   The first term and the factor j contribute to the phase only and all that is left for magnitude is a sine wave. The shape of the curve is the reason the term "comb" is used because there are L nulls in the frequency response at equally spaced intervals that makes the spectrum look like a comb.

## How to test
* Connect an ADC with a 1 bit output and get the 16 bit output

* Delta Sigma ADC
